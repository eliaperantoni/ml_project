    \section{Introduction}
    We want to build a machine learning classifier on the \emph{Human Activity
    Recognition with Smartphones} dataset, available at the following
    \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones}{link}.

    The data has been gathered by having $30$ subjects performing $6$ different
    physical activities (laying, standing, sitting, walking, walking upstairs
    and walking downstairs) while a waist-mounted smartphone records
    accelerometer and gyroscope state.

    Each sample originally consisted of $3$-axis linear acceleration and
    $3$-axis angular velocity but has been feature-engineered, by the authors,
    to a grand total of $561$ features, obtained by filtering, mixing and
    matching the primitive ones.

    \section{PCA}
    We start by performing \emph{Principal Component Analysis} on
